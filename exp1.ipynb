       "'JAILBREAKING LEADING SAFETY -ALIGNED LLM S\\nWITH SIMPLE ADAPTIVE ATTACKS\\nMaksym Andriushchenko\\nEPFLFrancesco Croce\\nEPFLNicolas Flammarion\\nEPFL\\nABSTRACT\\nWe show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple\\nadaptive jailbreaking attacks. First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage\\naccess to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt tem-\\nplate (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on\\na suffix to maximize a target logprob (e.g., of the token “Sure” ), potentially with\\nmultiple restarts. In this way, we achieve 100% attack success rate—according to\\nGPT-4 as a judge—on Vicuna-13B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3-Mini, Nemotron-4-340B,\\nLlama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Llama-3-Instruct-8B, Gemma-7B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,\\nand R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG at-\\ntack. We also show how to jailbreak allClaude models—that do not expose\\nlogprobs—via either a transfer or prefilling attack with a 100% success rate .\\nIn addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens\\nfor finding trojan strings in poisoned models—a task that shares many similari-\\nties with jailbreaking—which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in\\nthe SaTML’24 Trojan Detection Competition. The common theme behind these\\nattacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different\\nprompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts),\\nsome models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for\\nClaude), and in some settings, it is crucial to restrict the token search space based\\non prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). For reproducibility purposes, we\\nprovide the code, logs, and jailbreak artifacts in the JailbreakBench format\\nathttps://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks .\\nI NTRODUCTION\\nThe remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) carry the inherent risk of misuse,\\nsuch as producing toxic content, spreading misinformation or supporting harmful activities. To\\nmitigate these risks, safety alignment orrefusal training is commonly employed—a fine-tuning\\nphase where models are guided to generate responses judged safe by humans and to refuse responses\\nto potentially harmful queries (Bai et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). Although safety alignment is\\neffective in general, several works have shown that it can be circumvented using adversarial prompts.\\nThese are inputs specifically designed to induce harmful responses from the model, a practice known\\nasjailbreak attacks (Mowshowitz, 2022; Zou et al., 2023; Chao et al., 2023).\\nJailbreak attacks vary in their knowledge of the target LLM (ranging from white- to black-box\\napproaches, or API-only access), complexity (involving manual prompting, standard optimization\\ntechniques, or auxiliary LLMs), and computational cost. Moreover, the nature of the jailbreaks they\\nproduce differs: some methods insert strings with little semantic meaning (Zou et al., 2023), while\\nothers rephrase user requests to maintain natural language (Mehrotra et al., 2023). The effectiveness\\nof these attacks can significantly vary, achieving a high success rate on some target models but also\\ndrastically failing on others. For example, the Llama-2-Chat and Claude family of LLMs maintain\\nhigh robustness against existing attacks (Anthropic, 2024b; Touvron et al., 2023). Moreover, new\\ndefenses designed to counteract jailbreaks are emerging (Robey et al., 2023; Mazeika et al., 2024).\\nContributions. In this work, we examine the safety of leading safety-aligned LLMs in terms of\\nrobustness to jailbreaks. We show that it is feasible to leverage the information available about each\\nmodel, derived from training details or inference (e.g., logprobs), to construct simple adaptive at-\\ntacks, which we define as attacks that are specifically designed to target a given defense (Tram `er\\net al., 2020). Our main tool consists of a manually designed prompt template—which is used\\narXiv:2404.02151v3  [cs.CR]  7 Oct 2024\\nTable 1: Summary of our results. We measure the attack success rate for the leading safety-aligned\\nLLMs on the set of 50harmful requests from AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023) curated by Chao et al.\\n(2023). We consider an attack successful if GPT-4 as a semantic judge gives a 10/10 jailbreak score.\\nSuccess rate\\nModel Source Access Our adaptive attack Prev.

Our approach can be considered simple as it does not require gradient information (Zou et al.,\\n; Geisler et al., 2024), auxiliary LLMs to iteratively optimize the jailbreaks (Chao et al., 2023;\\nMehrotra et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2024), or multi-turn conversations (Cheng et al., 2024; Russi-\\nnovich et al., 2024). In this way, using the dataset of 50 harmful requests from AdvBench (Zou\\net al., 2023) curated by Chao et al. (2023), we obtain a 100% attack success rate on all leading\\nsafety-aligned LLMs , including Vicuna-13B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3-Mini, Nemotron-4-340B, Llama-\\n-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Llama-3-Instruct-8B, Gemma-7B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Claude-3/3.5, and the\\nadversarially trained R2D2. A summary of our main results in Table 1 suggests that our methods\\nsubstantially outperform the existing attacks and achieve a 100% attacks success rate on many mod-\\nelsfor the first time . We also show an illustrative example of a successful transfer attack on Claude 3\\nSonnet (Figure 5 in the appendix). Additionally, we show how to use random search on a restricted\\nset of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models—a task that shares many similarities with\\njailbreaking—enabling us to secure the first place in the SaTML’24 Trojan Detection Competition.\\nFinally, we list all our evaluations in Table 21 in the appendix, which we hope will serve as a valuable\\nsource of information on the robustness of frontier LLMs.\\nInsights. Our results provide several insights into the domain of safety in LLMs and its evaluation.\\nFirst, we reveal that currently both open-weight and proprietary models are completely non-robust\\nto adversarial attacks. Second, it is evident that adaptive attacks play a key role in the evaluation\\nof robustness, as no single method can generalize across all target models. Despite the absence of\\na standardized attack, we still provide recommendations for future research on designing jailbreak\\nattacks, analogous to the framework established for image classification by Carlini et al. (2019);\\nTram `er et al. (2020); Croce et al. (2022b), distilling key observations from our experiments.\\nR ELATED WORK\\nAdversarial attacks on machine learning models have a long history (Biggio et al., 2013; Szegedy\\net al., 2014; Biggio & Roli, 2018; Madry et al., 2018). In this section, we specifically focus on the\\ndifferent categories of LLM jailbreaking attacks .\\nManual attacks. ChatGPT users have discovered handcrafted jailbreaks (Mowshowitz, 2022). Wei\\net al. (2023a) systematically categorize these jailbreaks based on two main criteria: (1) competing\\nobjectives , which occurs when a model’s capabilities conflict with safety goals, and (2) mismatched\\ngeneralization , which arises when safety training does not generalize to domains where the model\\nhas capabilities. By leveraging these failure modes and employing a combination of manual attacks,\\nWei et al. (2023a) achieve high success rates on proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude v1.3.\\nWei et al. (2023b) explore jailbreaking using in-context learning prompts that contain a few exam-\\nples of harmful responses, while Anil et al. (2024) take it a step further by using many in-context\\nexamples and derive a predictable scaling trend for long-context LLMs.\\nDirect search attacks. The search for jailbreaks can be automated using first- or zeroth-order dis-\\ncrete optimization techniques. For example, Zou et al. (2023) introduce universal and transferable\\nattacks with a gradient-based method named Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), inspired by earlier\\ndiscrete optimization efforts in NLP (Shin et al., 2020). Lapid et al. (2023) use a genetic algorithm\\nto generate universal adversarial prompts within a black-box threat model, where gradients are not\\nused. Liu et al. (2023) apply genetic algorithms to combine sentence fragments into a low-perplexity\\njailbreak. Zhu et al. (2023) pursue a similar goal, modifying GCG to generate low-perplexity adver-\\nsarial suffixes. Liao & Sun (2024) propose to learn a separate model to generate adversarial prefixes\\nsimilar to GCG. More related to our work, Sitawarin et al. (2024); Hayase et al. (2024) suggest\\nemploying random search on predicted probabilities for black-box models to guide and refine the\\nadversarial string search, occasionally aided by a white-box LLM to identify the most promising to-\\nkens to change. For OpenAI models, both attacks use the logit bias parameter whose behavior\\nhas been already changed: it no longer influences the logprobs, rendering their attacks ineffective.\\nLLM-assisted attacks. Finally, using other LLMs for optimizing jailbreaking attacks has shown\\nconsiderable promise, primarily due to enhanced query efficiency. Chao et al. (2023) have first de-\\nveloped Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), a method that uses an auxiliary LLM to\\nidentify jailbreaks efficiently. Mehrotra et al. (2023) have then refined PAIR’s methodology, intro-\\nducing a tree-based search method. In similar vein, Shah et al. (2023) have devised an approach\\nto jailbreaks generation using an LLM that is guided by persona modulation. Meanwhile, Yu et al.\\n(2023) have introduced GPTFUZZER, a framework that iteratively enhances human-written tem-\\nplates with the help of an LLM. Zeng et al. (2024) have fine-tuned GPT-3.5 for the specific task of\\nrephrasing harmful requests, using the rephrased content to jailbreak a target LLM.\\nB ACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY\\nWe first outline background on jailbreaking and then discuss our attack methodology.\\n.1 S ETTING\\nBackground on jailbreaking. We focus on identifying prompts that, when given a specific harmful\\nrequest (e.g., “Tell me how to build a bomb”), induces the LLM to generate harmful content. We\\nassume access to a set of such requests recognized by most LLM providers as harmful (e.g., mis-\\ninformation, violence, hateful content) and are typically not responded to. We define a language\\nmodel LLM:T∗→ T∗as a function that maps a sequence of input tokens to a sequence of output\\ntokens, referred to as the target model , as it is the one we aim to jailbreak. Given a judge function\\nJUDGE :T∗× T∗→ {NO,YES}and a harmful request R∈ T∗, the attacker’s goal is:\\nfind P∈ T∗subject to JUDGE (LLM(P), R) =YES.\\nAlthough the judge may use a fine-grained evaluation score (such as a score from 1 to 10 for the\\nGPT-4 judge), it ultimately outputs a binary response indicating whether LLM(P)constitutes a valid\\njailbreak for the harmful request R.\\nOur setup. We use default system prompts unless specifically mentioned (modifications are only\\nmade for Claude) due to potential future restrictions by frontier LLM providers, who might limit\\naccess to the system prompt for safety reasons. Our targets comprise a set of 50 behaviors from\\nAdvBench curated by Chao et al. (2023) that ensures distinct and diverse harmful requests. We use\\nGPT-4 as the semantic judge (see Table 8 for the prompt) in line with the criteria established by\\nChao et al. (2023), where a jailbreak is considered successful only if it achieves a 10/10 jailbreak\\nscore from GPT-4. We also include results using the rule-based judge from Zou et al.

We follow this definition and\\ndescribe the building blocks of our adaptive attacks,\\nwhich we combine and adapt depending on the tar-\\nget LLMs. Importantly, we customize our adaptive\\nattacks for each model but not for each request.\\nPrompt templates. The importance of a well-\\ndesigned prompt in enhancing the performance of\\nLLMs is well-established (Wei et al., 2023a). In our\\napproach, we develop a prompt template that can in-\\ncorporate a generic unsafe request. This template is\\nspecifically designed to make the model start from\\na specified string (e.g., “Sure, here is how to make\\na bomb” ) and steer the model away from its default\\naligned behavior. Its general structure can be sum-\\nmarized as: set of rules +harmful request +adver-\\nsarial suffix . We have optimized the set of rules one\\nby one on the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to maximize\\nthe attack success rate and avoid the built-in safety\\nguardrails. We provide the complete template in Fig-\\nure 1. As we will see in Section 4 (Table 3), this\\nprompt template alone leads to 100% attack success\\nrate on GPT-3.5 Turbo, and it also provides a good\\nstarting point for other LLMs. We have also cus-\\ntomized this prompt for GPT-4o (see Table 7) and\\ndesigned another prompt template (referred to as the\\nin-context prompt ) that includes an example of an\\nunsafe behavior which the model is encouraged to\\nimitate (see Table 6).\\nRandom search. We use a simple random search\\n(RS) algorithm (Rastrigin, 1963) adapted for jail-\\nbreaking language models. The algorithm can be\\nsummarized as follows:\\n• Append a suffix of a specified length to the orig-\\ninal request.\\n• In each iteration, modify a few contiguous to-\\nkens at a random position in the suffix.\\n• Accept the change if it increases the log-\\nprobability of a target token (e.g., “Sure” that\\nleads the model to comply with a harmful re-\\nquest) at the first position of the response.\\nWe use adversarial suffixes initialized with 25tokens\\n(which we found to be a nearly optimal number—see\\nan example on Gemma-7B in Appendix B.1), we use\\nup to 10 000 iterations and up to 10 random restarts,\\nalthough in most cases a single restart suffices. This\\nstrategy, including the preference for suffixes over\\nprefixes and the focus on maximizing the probabil-\\nity of the token “Sure”, draws inspiration from the attack methodology of Zou et al. (2023). We\\nalso tried other affirmative words, such as “exactly” and “certainly”, but we did not observe any\\nimprovements. We opted for random search (1) due to its simplicity and efficiency, requiring only\\nlogprobs instead of gradients (thus also reducing the memory demands), and (2) motivated by its\\nsuccess in attacking vision models (Andriushchenko et al., 2020; Croce et al., 2022a).\\nSelf-transfer. It is well-known that initialization plays a key role in optimization algorithms, in-\\ncluding in random search based attacks (Andriushchenko et al., 2020). We leverage the adversarial\\nsuffix found by random search for a simpler harmful request as the initialization for random search\\non more challenging requests. We refer to this approach as self-transfer . Interestingly, this approach\\noften leads to a transferable adversarial suffix (or, at least, a good starting for a subsequent run of\\nrandom search), even though it is crafted for a single model and a single request. It significantly\\nboosts the query efficiency and attack success rate on many LLMs.\\nTransfer attacks. Successful jailbreaks developed for one LLM can often be reused on another\\nmodel (Zou et al., 2023). This observation will be crucial for attacking some of the Claude 3 models\\nthat do not expose logprobs making random search not applicable.\\nPrefilling attack. Some APIs like Claude allow users to directly prefill the LLM’s response with\\na specified beginning, making iterative optimization unnecessary. Thus, for Claude models, we\\nexplore prefilling the response with a string that corresponds to a target behavior (e.g., “Sure, here\\nis how to make a bomb” ). As a side note, prefilling is also straightforward to implement for any\\nopen-weight LLM, where the chat template can be modified directly (Vega et al., 2023).\\nReproducibility. For reproducibility purposes, we provide all further details in our repository1that\\ncontains the code, logs, and jailbreak artifacts in the JailbreakBench format.\\nJ AILBREAKING LEADING SAFETY -ALIGNED LLM S\\nIn this section, we detail the adaptive attacks we have developed for several families of leading\\nsafety-aligned LLMs, i.e., we focus primarily on production-grade models. We provide a detailed\\ndescriptions of the main evaluations here and show the rest in Table 21 in the appendix, where we\\nalso present results on Vicuna-13B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3-Mini, and Nemotron-4-340B.\\n.1 J AILBREAKING LLAMA -2, L LAMA -3,AND GEMMA MODELS\\nHere, we focus on open-weight Llama-2-Chat (7B, 13B, 70B parameters) (Touvron et al., 2023),\\nLlama-3-Instruct-8B, and Gemma-7B models (Google, 2023). For the Llama models, we use the\\nsafety prompt from Touvron et al. (2023) (see Section A.1 for more details) that improves resilience\\nto jailbreaks. These models have undergone significant safety training, rendering them resilient to\\njailbreaks, even in white-box scenarios (Zou et al., 2023).\\nApproach. The key element to jailbreak the Llama models is self-transfer , where successful ad-\\nversarial suffixes found by random search on simpler requests are used as initialization for random\\nsearch on more complex requests. Notably, these adversarial strings tend to be to some extent trans-\\nferable across different model sizes (e.g., from 7B to 13B models), but for the best result we repeat\\nthe self-transfer procedure for each model size separately. The same approach is also successful on\\nGemma-7B, although prompt + random search alone already demonstrates high attack success rate.\\nResults. Table 2 shows that we achieve 100% attack success rate on all these models. For Llama-\\n-Chat models, our standard adversarial prompt templates yield a 0% success rate, confirming the\\neffectiveness of their safety alignment. When we apply Prompt + random search the attack success\\nrate (ASR) increases to 48%. Ultimately, our composite attack strategy—which combines prompt-\\ning, random search, and self-transfer—achieves a 100% attack success rate for all LLMs, surpassing\\nall existing methods. For Llama-2-Chat-7B, the best reported success rate is 92% by PAP (Zeng\\net al., 2024) which is an LLM-assisted method. However, this method requires 10 restarts to achieve\\nsuch accuracy, and its success rate drops to 46% with only one restart. In contrast, for this model,\\none restart is sufficient for our method to achieve a 100% ASR. Meanwhile, for the 13B and 70B\\nhttps://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks\\nTable 2: Llama, Gemma, and R2D2.

We show convergence curves in Figure 2, where we plot the average logprob of\\nthe token ‘Sure’ and average ASR for three representative models (Llama-3-Instruct-8B, Llama-2-\\nChat-7B, and Gemma-7B) for random search (RS) with and without self-transfer. The plot confirms\\nthat starting from a good initialization via self-transfer is key for query efficiency and a high ASR.\\n.2 J AILBREAKING R2D2 M ODEL\\nR2D2 uses adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018), a technique effective for obtaining vision mod-\\nels robust to ℓp-bounded adversarial perturbations (Madry et al., 2018; Croce et al., 2021), to make\\nLLMs more robust to jailbreak attacks.\\nApproach. Similarly to Llama-2-Chat, the standard prompt template, alone or with RS, shows lim-\\nited effectiveness. However, in contrast to Llama-2-Chat, self-transfer is ineffective here. Motivated\\nby the fact that R2D2 was trained to refuse a specific prompt structure (i.e., request and adversarial\\nsuffix), we circumvent safety guardrails by using a different prompt structure. We use an in-context\\nlearning prompt (see Table 6 in the appendix), which we found the model to be particularly sensitive\\nto. We use random search on top of the in-context prompt to maximize the probability of the initial\\ntoken “Step” (instead of “Sure”) to be consistent with the new prompt template.\\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\\nIteration15.0\\n.5\\n.0\\n.5\\n.0\\n.5\\n.0Average target logprobLlama-3-8B, Prompt + RS\\nLlama-3-8B, Prompt + RS + self-transfer\\nLlama-2-7B, Prompt + RS\\nLlama-2-7B, Prompt + RS + self-transfer\\nGemma-7B, Prompt + RS\\nGemma-7B, Prompt + RS + self-transfer\\n2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\\nIteration0%20%40%60%80%100%Attack success rateLlama-3-8B, Prompt + RS\\nLlama-3-8B, Prompt + RS + self-transfer\\nLlama-2-7B, Prompt + RS\\nLlama-2-7B, Prompt + RS + self-transfer\\nGemma-7B, Prompt + RS\\nGemma-7B, Prompt + RS + self-transferFigure 2: Convergence curves.

Starting from a good initialization via self-transfer is key for query\\nefficiency and high attack success rate.\\nResults. As shown in Table 2, using the in-context prompt alone achieves a 90% attack success rate,\\nwhich random search boosts to 100%. This significantly surpasses the 61% reported by Mazeika\\net al. (2024) using TAP (Mehrotra et al., 2023). Interestingly, the in-context prompt is less effective\\non other models like Llama-2-Chat (see Table 21 in the appendix).\\n.3 J AILBREAKING GPT M ODELS\\nGPT models remain the most popular LLMs and have non-trivial safety alignment. We consider the\\nfollowing API checkpoints: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 ,gpt-4-1106-preview , and gpt-4o-2024-05-13 .\\nApproach. Since December 2023, OpenAI has made the predicted probabilities of their models\\navailable via the API, which we leverage for random search. We observed that GPT-3.5 Turbo is\\nextremely brittle to manually designed prompts, with no need for more sophisticated techniques.\\nIn contrast, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o demonstrate greater resistance to these adversarial prompt\\ntemplates. Thus, for these models, we rely on random search and self-transfer to achieve more\\nsuccessful jailbreaks. Additionally, for GPT-4o, we customize the prompt and split it onto a system\\nand user parts, see Table 7 in Appendix A.1 for details.\\nResults. Table 3 summarizes our results: with the prompt template alone, we achieve 100% success\\nrate on GPT-3.5 Turbo, outperforming the baselines. For GPT-4 Turbo, using the prompt alone\\nleads only to 28% success rate. However, by combining the prompt, RS, and self-transfer, we\\nimprove the previous best ASR from 59% (Mazeika et al., 2024) to 96%. Our default prompt\\ntemplate is completely ineffective against GPT-4o, resulting in 0% ASR. Moreover, running random\\nsearch on top of it does not lead to a significantly higher ASR. However, our custom template (see\\nAppendix A.1) already leads to 72% ASR, and we get to 100% ASR with random search and self-\\ntransfer. This large difference in the ASR again shows the importance of adaptive attacks that are\\ncustomized for a particular model.\\nNon-determinism in GPT-3.5/4. The limitation of the API providing only the top-20 log-\\nprobabilities is not critical, as it is often straightforward to prompt a desired token, such as “Sure”, to\\nappear in the top-20. A more challenging issue is the non-deterministic output, since random search\\ndoes not necessarily have a correct signal to refine the adversarial string. Identical queries can yield\\nvarying log-probabilities, as shown in Figure 3, even with a fixed seed and temperature zero in the\\nAPI. The randomness makes random search less effective, although it still succeeds to a large extent.\\n.4 J AILBREAKING CLAUDE MODELS\\nClaude models are known for their high safety levels. In line with this, Anthropic does not provide\\naccess to logprobs for these models which prevents direct iterative attack like random search. Thus,\\nwe first test a transfer attack using an adversarial suffix optimized on GPT-4 with random search. We\\nenhance the attack with multiple random restarts to leverage different generations with temperature\\none. Then we investigate an attack method that utilizes Anthropic’s prefilling feature (Anthropic,\\nTable 3: GPT models.

To improve\\nthe attack success rate, we use the prefilling feature together with our prompt (Figure 1) which we\\nsplit into a system and user part (see Tables 16 and 17 for a detailed ablation).\\nTransfer attack. As shown in Table 4, the direct transfer attack is especially effective on specific\\nmodels, such as Claude 3 Haiku, 3 Sonnet, and 3.5 Sonnet, with ASR rates of 98%, 100%, and\\n%, respectively. Given the recent release of Claude 3 and Claude 3.5, there are no established\\nbaselines for comparison. The attack success rate of the transfer attack improves when the initial\\nsegment of the prompt (which corresponds to the set of rules to follow) is provided as the system\\nprompt. In this way, we can achieve 100% ASR on Claude 2.0 and 98% ASR on Claude 3 Haiku.\\nWe present an illustrative example of a transfer attack on Claude 3 Sonnet in Figure 5 and show more\\ncomplete results in the appendix (Table 15). We conclude that while Claude models exhibit increased\\nrobustness against static harmful requests, their resistance to adversarial suffixes—challenging to\\nderive without logprobs—is not perfect.\\nPrefilling attack. The prefilling feature, combined with our prompt template, makes jailbreaking\\nwith 100% ASR straightforward on all Claude models—including Claude 3 and 3.5—even without\\nany search, as we show in  (Shah et al., 2023) while we get 100% using only up to 10 random restarts. The Claude 2.1 model\\nappears to be the most robust model in the Claude series and is significantly more robust to both\\ntransfer and prefilling attacks. Although we are able to get 100% ASR with 100 restarts, we note\\nthat GPT-4, as a semantic judge, sometimes produces false positives, particularly for this model.\\nWe provide more complete experimental results, including the number of restarts in each case, in\\nTables 16 and 17 in the appendix.\\nTable 4: Claude models.

Rando & Tram `er (2023) showed the possibility of implanting backdoor attacks during the\\nRLHF training of LLMs by poisoning a small percentage of the preference data with a universal\\nsuffix. Then a model that typically refuses to answer harmful queries can then be jailbroken by\\nappending the suffix to any request. Rando & Tram `er (2024) recently launched a competition to\\nretrieve backdoor attacks in five Llama-2-7B models, each poisoned with a different trojan. A\\nreward model was also provided to evaluate the safety of prompt-response pairs (higher scores to\\nsafer responses), alongside a dataset of harmful requests. The objective is to discover triggers (5 to\\ntokens long) acting as universal jailbreaks for each model.\\nApproach. Random search could be directly applied to optimize the score provided by the reward\\nmodel on some training examples. However, despite the triggers being relatively short, the search\\nspace is extremely large, as the vocabulary Tof the Llama-2 tokenizer comprises 32001 tokens, and\\nstraightforward random search becomes particularly inefficient. It is noteworthy that the five LLMs,\\ndenoted by M1, . . . , M 5, were fine-tuned from the same base model, thereby sharing the weights\\ninitialization, including those of the embedding matrix that maps tokens to the LLM’s continuous\\nfeature space (each token tiis associated with a vector vi∈R4096, fori= 0, . . . , 32000 ). Given that\\nthe tokens part of the trigger appear abnormally frequently, we anticipate that their corresponding\\nembedding vectors significantly deviate from their initial values. Building on this intuition, for any\\npair of models MrandMswith embedding matrices vrandvs, we compute the distance ∥vr\\ni−vs\\ni∥2for each token, sorting them in decreasing order πrs, where\\nπrs(i)< πrs(j) =⇒ ∥vr\\ni−vs\\ni∥2≥\\r\\rvr\\nj−vs\\nj\\r\\r\\n, i, j = 0, . . . , 32000 .\\nWe hypothesize that the trigger tokens for both MrandMsrank among those with the largest ℓ2-\\ndistance, identified in the set\\ntop-k(Mr, Ms) ={ti∈T:πrs(i)≤k}.\\nThe final pool of candidate trigger tokens for a model Mris the intersection of such sets:\\ncand(Mr) =T\\ns̸=rtop-k(Mr, Ms). Given that the five models are fine-tuned using different ran-\\ndom subsets of the training data, this approach is approximate but narrows down the candidate\\nTable 5: Trojan competition results. We present the scores obtained by implanting the triggers\\nidentified by each approach alongside no trigger and the true trigger for the five target models,\\nwhere lower values indicate higher success.

Our strategy to identify jailbreaking\\ntriggers for the poisoned model Mrinvolves conducting a random search in the token space over\\nthe set cand (Mr). We restrict the search to triggers of five tokens, as this length yielded the best\\nresults. In each iteration, we filter out candidate triggers that do not start with a blank space, contain\\nblank spaces or are not invariant to decoding-encoding,2following the competition hints. The ob-\\njective minimized by random search is the average score of the reward model on a batch of training\\nexamples, aiming to ensure the trigger’s universality (generalization to unseen prompts).\\nResults. In Table 5 we report the average scores of the reward model over a held-out test set of harm-\\nful prompts for the five models, and their sum: without the triggers, the models produce safe answers\\n(high scores), indicating proper alignment. We then compare the effectiveness of the triggers discov-\\nered by competing methods (those ranked 2nd and 3rd in the competition) with our approach: RS\\non the restricted set of tokens achieves the best (lowest) score for 3 out of 5 target models, as well as\\nthe best overall score. Moreover, the scores achieved by our method are not far from those given by\\nthe exact trojans, i.e. used to poison the datasets. We note that the numbers from Table 5 marginally\\ndiffer from the ones reported in Rando & Tram `er (2024): first, our top-1 entry was slightly better due\\nto the usage of gradient guidance for some models. Second, we re-evaluated all solutions, as well\\nas the models without triggers and with the true trojans, on the evaluation set3which led to slightly\\ndifferent values for all methods, but same ranking. To conclude, similarly to our approach for jail-\\nbreaking, our method includes an adaptive component (the selection of candidate token pools) that\\nleverages task-specific information, complemented by an automated optimization process through\\nrandom search.\\nD ISCUSSION , RECOMMENDATIONS ,AND LIMITATIONS\\nOur findings. Our work makes a few important methodological contributions.\\n. Our self-written prompt template serves as a strong starting point for further attack methods\\nand is even sufficient on its own to jailbreak multiple recent LLMs with a 100% success rate.\\n. Random search can find adversarial suffixes even without access to gradients and even when\\nonly top-20 logprobs are available, such as for GPT-4 models. In this setting, gradient-based\\nattacks like GCG can only be used as transfer attacks.\\n. Self-transfer is key for query efficiency and a high attack success rate of random search.\\n. Prefilling is a simple yet powerful attack that works on Claude and can also be applied to any\\nopen-weight model.\\nOur results also highlight how the API design of proprietary LLMs can facilitate new attacks (e.g.,\\nprefilling for Claude or random search for GPT models) but also hamper them (e.g., the inference-\\ntime randomness of GPT models). Additionally, we believe that our building blocks, such as prompt\\ntemplates, random search, and prefilling, can also be used to attack system-level defenses that rely\\non detectors of harmful generations, e.g., similarly to Mangaokar et al. (2024), where an adversarial\\nGiven a sequence of token indices, the tokenizer decodes it into a text string. However, re-encoding this\\nstring via the tokenizer does not guarantee the recovery of the initial sequence.\\nThe first half of the dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ethz-spyla\\nb/competition_eval_dataset .\\nprefix is optimized to bypass a detector model. Overall, we think that our findings will be very useful\\nin the long term for designing stronger defenses against jailbreaking attacks.\\nRecommendations. Our evaluation shows that the direct application of existing attacks is insuf-\\nficient for accurately evaluating the adversarial robustness of LLMs. Even using a large suite of\\nstatic attacks, as in Mazeika et al. (2024), can still lead to a significant overestimation of robustness.\\nThus, we believe it is important to use combinations of methods and identify unique vulnerabilities\\nof target LLMs. First, the attacker should take advantage of the possibility to optimize the prompt\\ntemplate, which alone can achieve a high success rate (e.g., 100% on GPT-3.5). Second, standard\\ntechniques from the adversarial robustness literature can make the attack stronger, such as transfer-\\nring an adversarial suffix or refining it iteratively via algorithms like random search, which may be\\npreferred over gradient-based methods due to its simplicity and lower memory requirements. Fi-\\nnally, one can leverage LLM-specific vulnerabilities, for example by providing in-context examples\\nor using the prefilling option. Importantly, in our case-study no single approach worked sufficiently\\nwell across all target LLMs , so it is crucial to test a variety of techniques, both static and adaptive.\\nLimitations. Even a perfect jailbreak score (10/10) from the GPT-4 judge does not always imply\\nthat the generated content is actually beneficial for an attacker. Although, if this is the case, one can\\ntry to ask follow-up questions as illustrated in Figure 5 or ask to output more sentences on each step.\\nTo reduce the risk of overfitting to the judge, we also include evaluations using a simple rule-based\\njudge from Zou et al. (2023), as well as Llama-3-70B and Llama Guard 2 judges in Appendix B.6.\\nThese judges also indicate a near-perfect attack success rate in almost all cases. We hope that new\\ngenerations of frontier LLMs will lead to more capable judges to evaluate jailbreaks.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nWe thank OpenAI for providing API credits within the Researcher Access Program, Ethan Perez and\\nAnthropic for providing free evaluation access to Claude models, and Valentyn Boreiko for proof-\\nreading the paper and providing valuable comments.

We optimize the trigger on batches of prompts from the available training set (we use only a\\nsmall fraction of all training examples), and select the best performing trigger on an a validation set.\\nB A DDITIONAL RESULTS\\nIn this section, we provide additional ablation studies and more detailed results, including those on\\nmodels not reported in the main part (e.g., Vicuna-13B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3).\\nB.1 E FFECT OF THE NUMBER OF TOKENS IN ADVERSARIAL SUFFIXES\\nHere, we justify the choice of 25 initial tokens for adversarial suffixes used in random search. In\\nFigure 4, we plot the average logprob of the token ‘Sure’ and attack success rate for a representative\\nmodel (Gemma-7B) using a limited number of iterations ( 1 000 ). We can see that both metrics\\nfollow a U-shaped trend with respect to the number of tokens in adversarial suffixes. In particular,\\nthe chosen number of tokens (25) that we use throughout the paper performs optimally. Moreover,\\nwe have observed that longer suffixes encounter the following two difficulties:\\n•Optimization difficulties : including more tokens leads to a worse objective value (i.e., lower\\ntarget logprob) on average. This can be counter-intuitive since with more tokens we use strictly\\nmore optimization variables, and it is natural to expect that we could get a better objective value.\\nHowever, in practice this does not happen which indicates optimization difficulties due to the\\ncomplex loss landscape.\\n•Difficulty of staying on-topic : we have often observed that very long suffixes (e.g., 60 tokens)\\nmake the model answer some unrelated request instead of a target harmful request. So even\\nwhen random search succeeds at producing ’Sure’ as the first token, the subsequent generation\\nis often not considered harmful by the jailbreak judge. This can be partially confirmed by\\nFigure 4: the run with 60 tokens has clearly the lowest attack success rate despite having not\\nthe lowest average target logprob value.\\n200 400 600 800 1000\\nIteration10\\n6\\n2\\nAverage target logprob5 tokens\\ntokens\\ntokens\\ntokens\\ntokens\\n200 400 600 800 1000\\nIteration20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0%60.0%Attack success rate5 tokens\\ntokens\\ntokens\\ntokens\\ntokens\\nFigure 4: Effect of the number of tokens in adversarial suffixes. We show the average logprob\\nof the token ‘Sure’ and attack success rate for Gemma-7B using a limited number of iterations\\n(1 000 ). We can see that both metrics follow a U-shaped trend with respect to the number of tokens\\nin adversarial suffixes. Moreover, the chosen number of tokens (25) that we use throughout the\\npaper performs optimally.\\nB.2 D ISCUSSION ON THE RUNTIME\\nThe overall cost of each iteration of random search is dominated by the forward pass through the\\ntarget LLM, and the cost of the rest of the operations is negligible. Moreover, due to early stopping,\\nthe overall number of iterations depends on the robustness of the target LLM and the success of the\\ninitialization. Importantly, what we describe as self-transfer —i.e., using an adversarial suffix found\\nby random search on a simpler harmful request as the initialization—is key for reducing the number\\nof iterations as we illustrate in Figure 2. In terms of wall-clock time, 4000 iterations of random\\nsearch on Llama-3-8B take 20.9 minutes on a single A100 GPU with an implementation based\\non HuggingFace transformers (Wolf et al., 2019) and without using any prefix caching techniques.\\nHowever, as Figure 2 shows, only less than 10% of all harmful behaviors require this number of\\niterations when self-transfer is applied, and most behaviors require less than 200 iterations. Thus,\\nthe total time of the whole experiment does not exceed a few hours.\\nB.3 F URTHER RESULTS ON CLAUDE MODELS\\nIn Table 15, we provide more detailed results for the transfer attack on Claude models depending\\non the number of restarts. In particular, we observe that with 100 restarts, we have a close to 100%\\nASR on Claude 2.0, Claude 3 Haiku, and Claude 3 Sonnet. Finally, we also provide an example of\\na transfer attack with and without the adversarial suffix in Figure 6.\\nIn Tables 16 and 17, we provide a further ablation for Claude models with different request structure\\nand report additionally the results of a rule-based judge from Zou et al. (2023).\\nTable 15: Transfer attack from GPT-4 on Claude.

Since\\nVicuna-13B (Chiang et al., 2023), Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023), Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct (3.8B\\nparameters) (Abdin et al., 2024), and Nemotron-4-340B (Nvidia team, 2024) are not significantly\\nsafety-aligned (i.e., they most likely have not been trained against even simple jailbreak attacks), we\\nomitted them from the main evaluation. However, these models are widely used, so we test their\\nrobustness for completeness.\\nAs shown by prior works (Chao et al., 2023), Vicuna-13B is not robust to jailbreaking attacks, so\\nwe only use our prompt template for the attack. For Mistral-7B, we use a slightly shortened version\\nof the prompt template (we refer to our code for details), and optimize the adversarial suffix with\\nrandom search. For Phi-3, we directly use our prompt template which we further refine with random\\nsearch. Nemotron-4-340B directly complies with harmful requests inserted in our prompt template,\\nso we do not even need to use random search.\\nFor Vicuna-13B the prompt template achieves 100% success rate (Table 21), matching the results\\nwith more complex methods. For Mistral-7B, the prompt alone attains 70% ASR, pushed to 100%\\nby using random search. For this model, Mazeika et al. (2024) reported 72% ASR, thus our approach\\nimproves the best known baseline for it. Our prompt template achieves 90% ASR on Phi-3 which is\\nfurther improved to 100% ASR with random search. Finally, the prompt template is very effective\\non Nemotron-4-340B, achieving 100% ASR without random search or random restarts.\\nTable 21: Summary of our evaluations.

      "1. **Evaluation on different datasets**: The paper uses HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024) and AdvBench (Wang et al., 2024), which might have different characteristics or biases compared to other benchmarks. This could affect the generalizability of the results.\n",
      "2. **False positives with GPT-4 as a judge**: The paper notes that GPT-4 exhibits multiple false positives on certain models, including Claude 2.1. This highlights the limitations of using a single judge, even if it's a strong one like GPT-4.\n",
      "3. **Limited exploration of attack success rates**: The paper focuses on transfer attacks from GPT-4 and doesn't extensively explore other types of attacks or defense mechanisms.\n",
      "4. **Lack of comparison to state-of-the-art defenses**: The paper doesn't directly compare its results to the latest state-of-the-art defenses against jailbreaking attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without more information, it's difficult to say whether these are actual limitations of the paper or potential areas for future research.\n",
